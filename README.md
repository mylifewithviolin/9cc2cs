# 9cc2cs
9cc2cs is a C# rewrite of 9cc, a small C compiler written in C by @rui314

I would like to implement a transcompiler, but I have never made a compiler, so
I will try to write the first half of the introduction to creating a C compiler in C# 
for those who want to know the low layer, which is often hit on the net 
and the first half is very detailed.
